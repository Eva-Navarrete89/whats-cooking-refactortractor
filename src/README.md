## Overview
In this project, we were given a codebase of a previous project that we were asked to refactor to make code follow DRY code, SRP, and TDD.

## Project Goals 
In this group project for Module 2 of [Turing](https://turing.edu/), the [goal](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-2/refactor-tractor-wc.html) of this project was to come into a codebase not our own and build on it. In doing so we were asked to refactor and DRY up code, make network requests with API endpoints, make the app more accessible and utilize Sass.
